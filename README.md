# Programming - Lab17

Investigate the domain and plot the function y=|sin(x)|+cos|x|.

When constructing function graph, the following should be considered:
1) at the beginning of the program the user sets the interval (maximum and minimum values along the x-axis), within which the graph should be constructed. Based on this, we can determine how the function changes to given interval (find its minimum and maximum value), and then calculate the scaling factors on the x-axis and in such a way that the graph occupies the maximum plane of the window;
2) if the abscissa and ordinate axes fall within the construction area, they should be constructed and unit intervals should be marked on them according to the scale. If they do not fall into the construction area - single intervals are marked along the edge of the window in which the graph is constructed;
3) the user must be able to move the graph right-left-up-down, as well as zoom in and out.
